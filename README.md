This is the official implementation of [LABEL-SAM](). (ICASSP 2025)

we will release the code in December ~

## Introduction

![](/figs/interface.png)

**LABEL-SAM** is a Annotation model towards solving Aortic dissection and vascular labeling issues in CT images. Our semi-automatic annotation LABEL-SAM model is based on [Meta AI](https://segment-anything.com/) to label AD objects in 3D medical images. At the same time, LABEL-SAM is integrated into the 3D slicer software as a plug-and-play plug-in for AD annotation work. LABEL-SAM can annotate in any view: coronal, axial or sagittal.
